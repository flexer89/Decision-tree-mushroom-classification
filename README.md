# Mushroom Classification Project

## Overview
This project focuses on the analysis of mushroom data and the development of a decision tree model to predict whether a mushroom is edible or poisonous. The dataset contains various attributes describing mushrooms, and the goal is to create a reliable classification model.

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on mushroom dataset
- Label encoding of categorical features
- Building a Decision Tree Classifier
- Evaluation using Confusion Matrix and Accuracy Score

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook (for running the provided analysis notebook)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/mushroom-classification.git
   cd mushroom-classification
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Mushroom_Classification.ipynb
   ```

## Project Structure
- `Mushroom_Classification.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the analysis and model development.
- `mushrooms.csv`: Dataset file.
- `requirements.txt`: List of Python dependencies.
